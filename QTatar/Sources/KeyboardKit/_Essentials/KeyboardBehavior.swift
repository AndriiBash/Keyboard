/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can define
 keyboard-specific behaviors.
 
 KeyboardKit will inject a ``StandardKeyboardBehavior`` into
 ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` then use it as the
 the default keyboard behavior.
 
 To change how your keyboard behaves, you can implement your
 own, custom behavior.

 To create a custom implementation of this protocol, you can
 either implement the protocol from scratch, or subclass the
 standard class and override what you want to change. Inject
 it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` to make it
 be used as the global default.
