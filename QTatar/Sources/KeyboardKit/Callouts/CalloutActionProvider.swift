/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can return
 secondary callout actions for any ``KeyboardAction``.
 
 KeyboardKit will register a ``StandardCalloutActionProvider``
 with ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``.
 
 To change the callout actions that are shown when different
 keys are long pressed, you can implement a custom provider.
 
 To create a custom implementation of this protocol, you can
 either implement the protocol from scratch, or subclass the
 standard class and override what you want to change. Inject
 it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` to make it
 be used as the global default.
 
 KeyboardKit Pro unlock localized providers for all locales.
