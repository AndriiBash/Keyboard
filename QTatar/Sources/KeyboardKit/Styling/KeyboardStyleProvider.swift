/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can define
 styles for different parts of a keyboard.
 
 KeyboardKit will register a ``StandardKeyboardStyleProvider``
 with ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``.
 
 To change the style of some parts of your keyboard, you can
 implement a custom style provider.
 
 To create a custom implementation of this protocol, you can
 either implement the protocol from scratch, or subclass the
 standard class and override what you want to change. Inject
 it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` to make it
 be used as the global default.
