/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 ``KeyboardAction``s.
 
 KeyboardKit will register a ``StandardKeyboardActionHandler``
 with ``KeyboardInputViewController/services``.
 
 To change how keyboard actions are handled by your keyboard,
 you can implement a custom provider.

 To create a custom implementation of this protocol, you can
 either implement the protocol from scratch, or subclass the
 standard class and override what you want to change. Inject
 it into ``KeyboardInputViewController/services`` to make it
 be used as the global default.
