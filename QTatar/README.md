## About KeyboardKit

KeyboardKit is a Swift SDK that lets you create fully customizable keyboards in a few lines of code, using SwiftUI.

KeyboardKit extends Apple's native APIs and provides you with a lot more functionality. It lets you mimic the native iOS keyboard and tweak its style and behavior, or create completely custom keyboards.

</p>

Custom iOS keyboard extensions can be used with all other apps that support text input. It's the only way for your product, brand or technology to directly interact with other apps on iOS. Don't miss out!

KeyboardKit can be used in different ways. Keyboard extensions can use it to create custom keyboards. Apps can use it to check keyboard state, full access, provide settings etc.



## Installation

KeyboardKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit.git
```

After installing KeyboardKit, make sure to link it to all targets that need it.



## Getting Started

After installing KeyboardKit, just make your `KeyboardViewController` inherit ``KeyboardInputViewController`` instead of `UIInputViewController`:

```swift
import KeyboardKit

class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {}
```

This gives your controller access to new lifecycle functions like `viewWillSetupKeyboard`, observable state like `state.keyboardContext`, services like `services.actionHandler`, and much more.

If you just want to use the default `SystemKeyboard` view, which mimics a native iOS keyboard and updates when the observable state changes, you don't have to do anything else. KeyboardKit will set up everything.

To replace or customize the default `SystemKeyboard`, just override `viewWillSetupKeyboard` and call `setup`:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    override func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
        super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()
        setup { controller in
            SystemKeyboard(
                state: controller.state,
                services: controller.services,
                buttonContent: { $0.view },
                buttonView: { $0.view },
                emojiKeyboard: { $0.view },
                toolbar: { _ in MyCustomToolbar() }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

For more information, please see the [getting started guide][Getting-Started].

## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has more information, articles, code examples, etc.



## Demo App

The demo app shows how to display keyboard state, link to system settings, etc. 

The demo app has two demo keyboards: 

* `Keyboard` uses KeyboardKit and a customized `SystemKeyboard`.
* `KeyboardPro` uses KeyboardKit Pro and enables all locales, autocomplete, themes, etc.

Just open and run the demo app in the `Demo` folder, then enable the keyboards under System Settings. Note that you need to enable full access for some features to work.



## KeyboardKit App

If you want to try KeyboardKit Pro without having to write any code or build the demo app from Xcode, there is a [KeyboardKit app][App] in the App Store, that lets you try out many pro features.
