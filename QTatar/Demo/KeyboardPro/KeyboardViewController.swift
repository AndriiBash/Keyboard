/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to setup Keyboard Pro with a
 license key, to unlock all locales and pro features.
 
 This keyboard uses KeyboardKit Pro autocomplete, instead of
 a fake provider like the other keyboard. It also customizes
 the keyboard layout with the ``DemoLayoutProvider`` and has
 a custom `ToggleToolbar` with a custom menu.
 
 Note that the dictation button in the toggle menu will open
 the app. However, since this demo app is not configured for
 the App Store, it has no App Group, which is needed to make
 dictation work and for sharing data between the two targets.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.

 ðŸ’¡ The project only links KeyboardKit Pro to the app target,
 which is how binary frameworks should be linked.
