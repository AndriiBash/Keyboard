/**
 This view uses a `SystemKeyboard` as the keyboard view, and
 customizes it with some Pro features.
 
 Note that `setup` and `setupPro` will use a `SystemKeyboard`
 by default. This demo customizes it a bit, to show how this
 is done. Just return `$0.view` in the `SystemKeyboard` view
 builders, if you just want to use the default view.
 
 > Important: When you customize your view, you need to make
 it observe the `KeyboardContext` in the environment. If you
 don't, this view will not detect any changes in the context
 and will not update itself.
